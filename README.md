# Energy Efficiency of Electric Vehicles: An Application for Consumption Calculation


Together, we have developed an innovative application using cutting-edge technologies such as C# and WPF for the graphical interface, while implementing an efficient database in Microsoft SQL Server for data storage. This project reflects our commitment to sustainability and research in the field of electric vehicles.

Our application allows users to assess the energy efficiency of electric vehicles, taking into account multiple variables such as distance, average speed, weather conditions, wheel size, and more.

Users enjoy an intuitive experience thanks to a user-friendly design, where the input of certain data, such as wheel size, is done by the user, while others, such as battery capacity, are retrieved from the database. This efficient integration contributes to a seamless user experience.
